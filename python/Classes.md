1. ***Namespace***: a *namespace* is a mapping from names to objects
	1. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. 
	2. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits.
