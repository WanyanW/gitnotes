### Namespaces and scopes
everything in Python - literals, lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, etc. - is an object.
Such a “name-to-object” mapping allows us to access an object by a name that we’ve assigned to it.
namespaces are just containers for mapping names to objects.
we have multiple independent namespaces in Python, and names can be reused for different namespaces (only the objects are unique, for example:
```
a_namespace = {'name_a':object_1, 'name_b':object_2, ...}
b_namespace = {'name_a':object_3, 'name_b':object_4, ...}
```
